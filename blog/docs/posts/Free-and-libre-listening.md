For a long time I have been looking for a way to purchase music that is not 
limited by copy-right protection and that I can use as I see fit. There are
several places where this is possible but in the end I found that for my 
specific requirements [bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com) which has most of the
labels I am interested in (Metal) and that also provides FLAC, OGG and other
formats.

I would like to point out here that my aim was not to replace streamed music
but rather find a way to both own my music collection and more directly support
the bands I love to listen to. Since I will never have a vast enough library to
supply my ever high-demand on music it is still a required Evil to stay with
the streamers.

In the end it boils down to the standard issue, if you are streaming content
you have no ownership. If you have no ownership then the data can be removed at
any point without you having a say. There are several[^1] examples where the
consumers have been the ones to suffer[^2]. It is not uncommon for content to
go missing and the streaming companies are fickle so there is never any 
guarantee. With the files provided by [bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com) I retain
stewerdship of the files and can setup my own services to stream or play them.

But I am actually not here for the politics of the non-ownership of anything in
this digital age. Rather to write about some about my current listening habits.

First and foremost; when the leaves start falling of the trees and the cold 
settles in I usually tend to start listening to bands like [Cattle-decapitation](https://cattledecapitation.bandcamp.com/album/terrasite)
and [Shadow Of Intent](https://shadowofintent7.bandcamp.com/album/imperium-delirium).

Both of which is fitting to listen to when the world dies around you both 
physically and metaforicaly. Other bands like [In flames](https://inflamesofficial.bandcamp.com/album/foregone) 
are more of a old-friend that you meet again and understand that you still have
a lot in common. Their latest album brings back the memories of those early
days in the beginning of my music-listening career. [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com)
has really made me actively rediscover music again, something I have not had to
do in a long time.

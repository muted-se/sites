So let us start out by discussing the purpose of this blog in greater detail. The primary purpose of the texts herein is to scratch a creative itch, I am not eloquent or well versed but I do feel the need to express myself sometimes in the written word. Secondly I have no intention of writing things that is in any way delivered in any scheduled way. That being said I think it is time to make a small effort in adding texts at a semi-regular basis. Thirdly it still feels like I need to contribute something into the void, either with guides or with guidance.

I should note here that I am well aware of the amount of traffic I garner every month and that my rants and ravings are read mostly by the forgotten and unseen bots. This is in the end a question about allowing me an outlet of some of my word-puke with the chance that someone might stumble upon this site and find it amusing.

## The promise to be broken
At the end of the day I do have some time right now for retrospectives and thinking about things. Thus I am in the process of creating some texts that I have felt I need to write. Mostly about perspectives on environment design, almost a philosophical manifest of sorts. One key difference between then and now is spelled children, my firstborn arrived neigh three years and a score of days ago. With my second child arriving there has been little time over for personal matters. As such it did put things on hold since there was two tiny beings to take care of. But as time has passed so has the direct need for them to be entertained by me and I am yet again having some actual spare time. But with age comes some experience and I am very certain I will have to yet again drop away from the face of the earth for some reason, cannot hinder life from happening for sure.

## But then again why not?
Still even if this will turn out to be a futile effort I am sitting here thinking about things, I do believe strongly in having achievable goals. So let us then set some goals for the near future. I want to deliver at least one post each month, of any length, and deliver at least one guide on how I organise file-systems and the philosophy behind this.

- [x] A post for each month
	- [x] May
	- [ ] June
	- [x] July
	- [ ] August
	- [ ] September
	- [ ] October
	- [ ] November
	- [ ] December
- [ ] Guide on file-system organisation

It should be noted that I am also working on my home-lab which was due for some major changes and I think that might be of interest to. Either way I have material ready so let us see where this takes us.

# ðŸ¤µ About #
## The Author ##
There is no greater task then to try and keep a introduction about oneself 
short, concise, honest and most importantly from sounding like posturing. 
But we can always try;

My name is Joakim Dellrud and I am a IT individual by day and geek by night. 
I utilize this space to write things I feel like writing about, technology, 
books and general thoughts that I might have.

I am a avid proponent of all things Linux with a special love for the 
philosophy that Opensource represents. My operating system of choice is 
AlmaLinux and I do have a server buzzing away at home. 

## The philosophy ##

    Linux enthusiast by day and nerd by night. Also a avid reader and of 
    course love everything Star Wars. Sometimes a cabin dweller, usually 
    found in Sweden. Sometimes found chatting on #sourbeard@libera.chat.

    One of the human conditions is our will to explore the unknown, our 
    curiosity for the unexplained. Our irresistible yearning for knowledge. 
    The mind that tries and fails and tries again. Our will to solve the 
    problems, find logic in chaos and to have fun.

-   __FREEDOM__

    ---
    We do not only believe in Open when it comes to Linux but to the free and 
    available knowledge to all. Free information creates and grows with those 
    whom are teached and will benefit more if shared rather then collected.

-   __OPENNESS__

    ---
    As with all Linux we love Opensource. But since we are neither, coders nor 
    creators we have only our knowledge to share what we know. So our 
    contribution to the Opensource community is this site.

privacy and have some ideas on how to proceede in those areas.

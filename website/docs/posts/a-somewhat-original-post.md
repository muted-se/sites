# Yet another Original post #
For those whom do not understand the joke I tend to write a post named 
something like "somewhat original again" every time I switch my hosting 
platform. This time is no different but I am also yet again thinking I might
have some time over to actually post from time to time. This has never been the
case before but as they say

> only an idiot does things repeatadly whithout learning anything from it.

In either case I will now walk through some of the thinking behind this post.

<!-- more -->
First and foremost I have decided to give up on any larger hosting provider. I
know that there is litterally not even AI bots visiting this site anyway but
paying for the hosting seems silly to me. To my help is that I have been 
provided with two basic nodes local to Stockholm that I will use to host 
content. It becomes interesting when we get to know the limiting factor has yet
again become the hardware.

Leading up to my choice of `mkdocs` with the `material` theme. First and 
foremost it makes the site look somewhat awesome, but it is also static.
